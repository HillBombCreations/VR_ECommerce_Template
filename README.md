## 🛠️ How to Customize for Your Business

Most content you’ll want to change is marked with `[UPDATE whatever you nedd to add]` comments directly in the code.

### 🔎 How to find and update your info:

1. Open the project in GitHub Codespaces or your preferred code editor.
2. If in a Codespace or VSCode you can use the **magnifying glass icon on the left sidebar** to search the entire project.  
   - If you are using a different editor, use its global search or "Find in Files" feature (usually available via `Ctrl+Shift+F` or `Cmd+Shift+F`).
3. Search for `UPDATE`.
4. Replace placeholder text such as [UPDATE add company name], contact info, policy dates, and emails with your own details.
5. Save your changes.

> **Tip:** Searching for `UPDATE` ensures you don’t miss any critical spots to personalize.
